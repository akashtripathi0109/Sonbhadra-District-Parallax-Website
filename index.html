            The 400-feet-tall, 5th-century Vijaygarh Fort was constructed by the <b>Kol kings</b> in Sonbhadra district in Uttar Pradesh. It is situated in <b>Mau Kalan village</b> on Robertsganj-Church road approximately 30 km from Robertsganj. Around half of the area of the fort is filled by steep rocky hills of <strong>Kaimur Range</strong>. Some of the unique features of the fort include cave paintings, statues, rock inscriptions and the four perennial ponds that never go dry. The main gate is preceded by a tomb of Muslim saint, Saiyyed Zain-ul-Abdin Meer Sahib, popularly called Hazrat Meeran Shah Baba. An Urs or a fair dedicated to the great saint is held every year in April which draws large crowds of devotees of all faiths. Two other landmarks located near the fort are the tanks known as Mira Sagar and Ram Sagar. Wedged between them is the Rang Mahal, which houses beautiful rock carvings. Kanwarias or the devotees of God Shiva fill their pitchers from Ram Sagar before starting their foot-march to their homes.

            Naugarh Fort is a small structure situated approximately 2 km from Naugarh township in Robertsganj and 40 km in the southern side of Chakia in Sonbhadra district of Uttar Pradesh. The fort was built by the Kashi Naresh. Of late, it is being used as a guest house for government officers. The fort offers panoramic views of Karmnasha river and the surrounding areas. The Naugarh Fort has some remains found around it. These remains date back to 3000 years and stand testimony to the ancient history of this site. A mountain, popularly called Geruwatwa Pahar, located in the north-western side of the fort, is replete with metal and mineral waste and the remains of furnaces. This slag is found on both sides of a small stream that joins Karmnasha river and forms a fascinating waterfall. It then turns into a stream which flows to the north-eastern side of Naugarh Fort.

            Salkhan Fossil Park is situated inside the Kaimoor Wildlife Sanctuary of Sonbhadra district in UP. It lies 17 km from Robertsganj, the district headquarter. The park essentially represents the geological heritage of the district Sonbhadra. The tree fossils are, in fact, the petrified or concretised form of the organic matter found in tree stumps. The algae or the stromatolites type fossils appear as circular stony formations over the boulders scattered in the region. According to geologists, the tree fossils are approximately 1400 millions years old and their origin date back to Proterozoic period. Spread over an area of around 25 hectares, the park is three times larger and much older than the Yellowstone National Park of USA. As pointed out by the local environment protection activists, Salkhan Fossil Park is an invaluable geological treasure not only of the country, but for the whole world. Its fossils provide a wealth of information about the origin of the planet earth as well of life itself.
